## Catalog
In **AFS**, we provide the analytic methods and tools in **Catalog**. The users can subscribe the methods and use them in **Workspaces**. When creating a **Solution** in **Workspaces**, there are two nodes, firehose and OTA, we must subscribe them then develope the new solution. About creating new **Solution**, please refer [Solution](https://afs-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/portal/workspace.html#solution)
